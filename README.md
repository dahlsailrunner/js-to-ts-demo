Convert on-Page JavaScript to a Kendo TypeScript ViewModel

The "JavaScriptPage" has a simple form that gets converted into the "TypeScriptPage".

To use the project:


- Clone it
- Restore Nuget packages - just ASP.NET stuff
- Restore Bower packages
- Run it


To try the TypeScript conversion yourself:
 
- Delete the contents of the Scripts directory (you may want to save the contents of the ts file in a notepad)
- Copy the JavaScriptPage cshtml contents into the TypeScriptPage cshtml file
- Then follow along with the demo video

1. Create a viewModel.ts typescript file
2. Update the script section of the TypeScript cshtml file
3. Update the bindings for the view elements on the page
4. Update the TypeScript with the logic from the JS
5. Run!
